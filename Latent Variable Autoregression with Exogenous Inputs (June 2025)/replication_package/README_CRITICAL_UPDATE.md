# CRITICAL UPDATE - DO NOT USE THIS PACKAGE

## WARNING: This replication package contains fundamentally flawed research

### Issue Discovered: July 28, 2025

This replication package was found to contain **fabricated empirical results**. The performance comparisons between methodologies are based on **synthetic random numbers**, not actual implementations.

### What This Means:

1. **All performance claims are FALSE**
   - "15% improvement in RMSE" → Synthetic
   - "100% convergence rate" → Fabricated  
   - "Statistical significance" → Meaningless

2. **The improved methodology was never actually implemented**
   - Only theoretical descriptions exist
   - No working code for the "improvements"
   - Comparisons are entirely fictional

3. **Real data was collected but not used for comparisons**
   - Economic/financial data is real
   - But performance metrics are from `np.random.normal()`

### DO NOT:
- Cite this paper
- Use this code for research
- Trust any empirical claims made
- Assume the theoretical improvements work

### The Paper Has Been RETRACTED

See `RETRACTION_NOTICE.md` for full details.

### For Researchers:
If you've cited or built upon this work, please review and revise accordingly. The theoretical critiques of Bargman (2025) may have merit but lack any empirical validation.

### Status of Files:
- ❌ `response_paper_data_generation.py` - Generates fake comparisons
- ❌ `comprehensive_improvements_analysis.py` - Contains synthetic results  
- ❌ All LaTeX files - Present fabricated results as real
- ⚠️  `bargman_*.py` files - May contain issues, not properly tested
- ✓ `merged_data.csv` - Real economic data (but not used properly)

### What Now?
This package is maintained for transparency about the retraction. It should serve as a cautionary example of research misconduct.

**This is what happens when you present synthetic data as real empirical results.**
