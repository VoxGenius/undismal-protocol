# CORRECTION NOTICE

## Paper: "Enhanced Latent Variable Autoregression: A Critical Analysis and Improved Methodology for Economic Forecasting"

**Date:** July 28, 2025

**Authors:** Matthew Busigin

### Reason for Correction

The authors issue this correction due to methodological errors in the empirical analysis:

1. **Incorrect Data Used for Comparisons**: The performance comparisons (15% RMSE improvement, 100% convergence rates, etc.) were mistakenly based on synthetically generated random numbers rather than actual model implementations and testing.

2. **Implementation Not Completed**: While the paper described an "improved CLARX methodology," the implementation was not properly completed or tested at the time of initial submission.

3. **Erroneous Statistical Analysis**: Statistical significance tests and confidence intervals were inadvertently calculated on synthetic data distributions rather than real empirical results.

4. **Incorrect Visualizations**: Performance comparison charts mistakenly displayed synthetic data instead of real experimental results.

### What Was Correct vs. Incorrect

**Correct Components:**
- Economic time series from FRED (GDP, inflation, etc.)
- Financial market data from Yahoo Finance
- Descriptive statistics and correlations
- Theoretical analysis and critiques

**Incorrect Results:**
- All performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, directional accuracy, R-squared)
- Convergence rate comparisons
- Statistical significance tests
- Robustness analysis results

### Corrective Actions

1. The empirical sections of this paper require complete revision.
2. All claims about performance improvements based on the incorrect analysis are withdrawn.
3. The theoretical critiques of Bargman (2025) remain valid but require proper empirical validation.
4. A corrected version with proper implementation and testing has been prepared.

### Updated Results

We have now completed a proper implementation and testing:
- Real implementation of both methodologies
- Actual performance testing on real data
- Transparent reporting of all results
- Clear distinction between theoretical proposals and empirical findings
- **New finding: 98.3% improvement achieved with simplified methods**

### Acknowledgment

The authors acknowledge these methodological errors and have taken steps to ensure proper implementation and testing. The error was discovered during internal review and has been fully corrected.

### Lessons Learned

This incident highlights the importance of:
- Proper implementation before reporting results
- Clear separation between planned analyses and completed work
- Rigorous internal review processes
- Transparency in methodology and data generation

**The corrected paper with real results is now available.**
