  - Blockwise Direct Sum Operator (A‚äï)
  - Blockwise Kronecker Product operations
  - Fixed point solution derivation

### ‚ùå NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
- [ ] **Exact Data Methodology**
  - Investing.com sector indices (not Yahoo Finance ETFs)
  - Exponentially decaying sample weights (10-year half-life)
  - Rolling regression framework
  
- [ ] **Core (C)LARX Algorithm**
  - Constrained latent variable optimization
  - Variance targeting for latent factors
  - GDP component weight constraints

## Critical Observations & Issues

### 1. Data Source Discrepancies
**Issue:** Original paper uses Investing.com sector indices, but we used Yahoo Finance sector ETFs
**Impact:** May affect latent factor construction and results
**Status:** Need to investigate data source alternatives or accept limitation

### 2. Mathematical Complexity
**Issue:** The blockwise direct sum operator A‚äï is central to the methodology but not standard
**Impact:** Current PCA approximation may not capture true (C)LARX behavior
**Status:** Must implement exact mathematical framework

### 3. Sample Size Limitations
**Issue:** Our current sample has only 25 quarterly observations (2018-2025)
**Impact:** Insufficient for robust rolling regression analysis
**Original:** Paper uses Q4 1989 - Q1 2025 (140+ quarters)
**Status:** Data collection issue needs resolution

### 4. Constraint Implementation
**Issue:** Paper imposes variance constraints on latent variables with specific targeting
**Impact:** Current unconstrained PCA doesn't match methodology
**Status:** Critical for authentic replication

## Referee Questions & Responses

### Q1: How does the blockwise direct sum operator work in practice?
**A:** From Section 2, A‚äï creates block diagonal matrices from sequences. Need to implement:
```
A‚äï = diag(A‚ÇÅ, A‚ÇÇ, ..., A‚Çñ)
```
for matrix sequences with arbitrary dimensions.

### Q2: What is the exact form of the (C)LARX fixed point solution?
**A:** From Section 5, involves solving for weight vectors œâ that minimize conditional variance subject to constraints. The solution is iterative and involves matrix operations with the A‚äï operator.

### Q3: How are the exponential weights applied in rolling regressions?
**A:** 10-year half-life means weights decay as exp(-ln(2) * t/40) for quarterly data. Need to implement in estimation procedure.

## Current Results vs Paper Benchmarks

| Model | Our R¬≤ | Paper MSPE % | Status |
|-------|---------|--------------|---------|
| Baseline OLS/ARX | 59.5% | 49.0% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Different metrics |
| LARX a) Market | 55.4% | 34.7% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Simplified method |
| LARX b) Output | 46.9% | 34.3% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Simplified method |
| LARX c) Both | 57.9% | 20.1% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Simplified method |

**Note:** Direct comparison not valid - we report in-sample R¬≤, paper reports out-of-sample MSPE.
