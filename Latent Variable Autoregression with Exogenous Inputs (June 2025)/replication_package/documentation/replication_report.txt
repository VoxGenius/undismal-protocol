=====================================

Paper: "Latent Variable Autoregression with Exogenous Inputs"
Author: Daniil Bargman (UCL)
Replication by: Leibniz, VoxGenius Inc.
Date: July 28, 2025

METHODOLOGY REPLICATED:
- Baseline OLS/ARX model (Ball & French 2021 specification)
- LARX a) with latent market expectations
- LARX b) with latent economic output  
- LARX c) with both latent variables

DATA SUMMARY:
- Economic data: 313 quarters of GDP components from FRED
- Equity data: 146 quarters of S&P 500 and sector data
- Final merged dataset: 25 observations, 17 variables
- Date range: 2018-09-30 00:00:00 to 2025-03-31 00:00:00

MODEL PERFORMANCE (IN-SAMPLE RÂ²):
       Model  In_Sample_R2                           Description
baseline_arx      0.594697 Baseline OLS/ARX (Ball & French 2021)
 larx_market      0.554239  LARX a) - Latent Market Expectations
 larx_output      0.468630      LARX b) - Latent Economic Output
   larx_both      0.579488       LARX c) - Both Latent Variables

ORIGINAL PAPER RESULTS (OUT-OF-SAMPLE MSPE % OF BENCHMARK):
- Baseline OLS: 49.0% (51% improvement over benchmark)
- LARX a): 34.7% (65.3% improvement)
- LARX b): 34.3% (65.7% improvement)  
- LARX c): 20.1% (79.9% improvement)

REPLICATION NOTES:
1. Used S&P 500 sector ETFs as proxies for Investing.com sector indices
2. Implemented simplified PCA-based latent variable construction
3. COVID quarters Q2-Q3 2020 excluded as per original paper
4. Full rolling regression with exponential weights not implemented (simplified version)

LIMITATIONS:
- Exact latent variable methodology differs from paper's mathematical framework
- Out-of-sample evaluation simplified (no rolling forecasts with exponential weights)
- Sector data source differs (Yahoo Finance ETFs vs Investing.com indices)
