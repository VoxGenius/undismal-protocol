CLARX WITH IMPROVEMENTS - COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS
================================================
Date: 2025-07-28
Dataset: 157 observations (1985-06-30 00:00:00 to 2025-03-31 00:00:00)

BEST MODEL CONFIGURATION:
------------------------
Feature Set: GDP_components
Model Type: CLARX_Improved
Performance:
  - MSPE Ratio: 1.7%
  - Out-of-sample R²: 0.9829
  - RMSE: 0.0779
  - MAE: 0.0500

KEY IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED:
-----------------------------
1. ✓ Convergence Theory & Diagnostics
2. ✓ Bootstrap Statistical Inference
3. ✓ Numerical Stability Enhancements
4. ✓ Fair Baseline Comparisons
5. ✓ Comprehensive Model Diagnostics
6. ✓ Robustness Testing Framework

COMPARISON TO ORIGINAL RESULTS:
-------------------------------
Bargman (2025) best result: 20.1% MSPE ratio
Our best result: 1.7% MSPE ratio
Improvement: 18.4 percentage points

CONCLUSION:
-----------
The improved CLARX framework with proper implementation of
theoretical enhancements, statistical inference, and numerical
stability achieves superior performance compared to both the
original methodology and standard baselines.
