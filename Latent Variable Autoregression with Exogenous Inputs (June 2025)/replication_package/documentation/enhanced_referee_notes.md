## I. CRITICAL LIMITATIONS IDENTIFIED

### üö® **CRITICAL ISSUES** (Require Immediate Attention)

#### 1. **Mathematical Convergence Theory Gap**
- **Problem**: No proof that the fixed point iteration converges
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Algorithm may be fundamentally unstable
- **Evidence**: Lines 1396-1398 mention iteration but provide no convergence analysis
- **Impact**: Results may be unreliable or irreproducible

#### 2. **Statistical Inference Absence**
- **Problem**: No standard errors, confidence intervals, or significance tests
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Cannot assess statistical validity
- **Evidence**: Table results (lines 1644-1651) show only point estimates
- **Impact**: Performance claims cannot be statistically validated

#### 3. **Identification and Uniqueness Issues**
- **Problem**: Solution uniqueness not established
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Multiple "equally valid estimates" acknowledged
- **Evidence**: Lines 1507-1509 admit identification problems
- **Impact**: Results may not have clear economic interpretation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES**

#### 4. **Numerical Stability Concerns**
- **Problem**: Matrix inversions without singularity safeguards
- **Severity**: HIGH - Algorithm will fail in practice
- **Evidence**: "Four matrices need to be inverted" (line 1398) with no error handling
- **Impact**: Implementation crashes on ill-conditioned data

#### 5. **Unfair Baseline Comparison**
- **Problem**: (C)LARX uses more information than baselines
- **Severity**: HIGH - Performance gains may be spurious
- **Evidence**: Uses sector breakdowns vs. aggregate S&P 500 in baseline
- **Impact**: Cannot determine true methodological contribution

#### 6. **Sample Size Limitations**
- **Problem**: Only 138 observations with further fragmentation
- **Severity**: HIGH - Insufficient statistical power
- **Evidence**: Q4 1989 - Q1 2025 sample with COVID exclusions
- **Impact**: Results may be driven by small sample artifacts

### üìä **MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES**

#### 7. **Data Quality and Look-Ahead Bias**
- **Problem**: Uses revised data instead of real-time vintages
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Overstated practical performance
- **Evidence**: GDP data from FRED without vintage considerations
- **Impact**: Real-world applicability overstated

#### 8. **Computational Scalability Problems**
- **Problem**: O(n¬≥) complexity limits practical applications
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Method won't scale to larger problems
- **Evidence**: Matrix inversions at each iteration step
- **Impact**: Limited to small-scale applications
