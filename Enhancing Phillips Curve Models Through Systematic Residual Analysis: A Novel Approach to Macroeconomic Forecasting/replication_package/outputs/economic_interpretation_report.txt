ECONOMIC INTERPRETATION & SIGNIFICANCE ANALYSIS\n============================================================\n\nKEY FINDINGS:\n---------------\n• Enhanced Phillips Curve substantially improves inflation explanation\n• External sector and market expectations are important inflation drivers\n• Multiple testing corrections eliminate statistical significance\n• Out-of-sample validation confirms real forecasting improvements\n• Structural breaks confirm Phillips Curve instability over time\n• Robustness checks validate core findings across specifications\n\nECONOMIC INSIGHTS:\n--------------------\n• Exchange rate effects on inflation operate with substantial lags\n• Market-based expectations complement survey-based measures\n• Traditional Phillips Curve captures only part of inflation dynamics\n• Structural instability requires adaptive modeling approaches\n\nMETHODOLOGICAL CONTRIBUTIONS:\n------------------------------\n• Systematic framework for Phillips Curve enhancement\n• Comprehensive treatment of multiple testing issues\n• Integration of theory-guided and empirical approaches\n• Emphasis on out-of-sample validation over in-sample fit\n\nPOLICY RELEVANCE:\n------------------\n• Improved inflation forecasting for monetary policy\n• Better understanding of policy transmission channels\n• Recognition of time-varying economic relationships\n• Evidence-based approach to model updating\n
