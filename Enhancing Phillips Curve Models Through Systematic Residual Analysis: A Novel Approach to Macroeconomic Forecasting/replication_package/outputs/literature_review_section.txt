LITERATURE REVIEW SECTION\n==================================================\n\nINTRODUCTION\n------------\nThe Phillips Curve, originally documented by Phillips (1958), represents one of the most important 
relationships in macroeconomic theory, linking unemployment and inflation dynamics. Since its 
introduction, extensive research has developed both the theoretical foundations and empirical 
methodologies for estimating and enhancing Phillips Curve models.\n\nFOUNDATIONAL WORK\n-----------------\nThe original Phillips Curve established the inverse relationship between unemployment and wage 
inflation in the United Kingdom. This work was extended by Okun (1962), who developed the 
complementary relationship between unemployment and output gaps, now known as Okun's Law. 
These foundational relationships form the core of modern macroeconomic models used for policy 
analysis and forecasting.\n\nMETHODOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n---------------------------\nSignificant methodological advances have enhanced Phillips Curve estimation. Hodrick and Prescott (1997) 
introduced the HP filter for trend-cycle decomposition, while Baxter and King (1999) developed 
alternative band-pass filtering approaches. More recently, Kamber et al. (2018) proposed the 
Beveridge-Nelson filter for more intuitive output gap estimates.

The challenge of structural instability in Phillips Curve relationships has been addressed through 
structural break testing methodologies developed by Bai and Perron (2003). These techniques allow 
for the systematic detection of parameter changes over time, which is crucial given the known 
instability of Phillips Curve relationships across different economic regimes.\n\nMODEL SELECTION\n---------------\nModern econometric practice emphasizes the importance of systematic model selection procedures. 
Hjort and Claeskens (2003) developed frequentist model averaging estimators that account for 
model uncertainty. The multiple testing problem, central to our methodology, has been extensively 
studied in the econometric literature, with various correction procedures developed to control 
family-wise error rates and false discovery rates.\n\nRECENT APPLICATIONS\n-------------------\nRecent empirical work has focused on enhancing Phillips Curve models through systematic variable 
selection and validation. Ball et al. (2017) revisited Okun's Law relationships using modern data, 
while Fleischman and Roberts (2011) developed multivariate approaches to trend-cycle decomposition 
that incorporate multiple economic indicators.

The integration of real-time data constraints, as emphasized in our ALFRED-based validation approach, 
reflects the practical requirements of policy-relevant forecasting models. This addresses the 
critique that many academic models perform well in-sample but fail to deliver reliable real-time 
forecasts.\n\nCONTRIBUTION\n------------\nOur research contributes to this literature by developing a systematic framework for Phillips Curve 
enhancement that combines rigorous statistical methodology with economic theory. The "Undismal Protocol" 
addresses several gaps in existing approaches: (1) systematic out-of-sample validation with real-time 
data constraints, (2) comprehensive treatment of multiple testing issues, (3) theory-guided variable 
selection across multiple economic domains, and (4) transparent documentation of all modeling decisions.\n\n
