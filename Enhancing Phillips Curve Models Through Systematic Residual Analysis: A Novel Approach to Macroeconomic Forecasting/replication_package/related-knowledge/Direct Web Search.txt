It appears there may be a discrepancy in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data for the period 1970-2023, possibly due to a switch from year-over-year (y/y) to month-over-month (m/m) calculations. Such inconsistencies can arise from data revisions or methodological changes. For instance, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis notes that updates in data collection methodologies can lead to revisions in economic statistics, affecting the reported values over time.

Additionally, the choice between y/y and m/m inflation reporting can impact data interpretation. Year-over-year comparisons smooth out short-term volatility but may lag in reflecting recent changes, while month-over-month data capture immediate fluctuations but can be more volatile. Understanding the context and methodology behind the data is crucial for accurate analysis.

As for theory-grounded candidate generation, this approach involves creating potential solutions based on established theoretical frameworks. It ensures that generated candidates are not only diverse but also align with underlying principles, leading to more effective and interpretable outcomes. The success of this method often depends on the robustness of the theoretical models employed and the quality of data used.
