DATA INTEGRITY ISSUE RESOLVED
===============================
Agent: Leibniz, VoxGenius Inc.
Date: 2025-07-29
Status: CORRECTED

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
- The enhanced_visualizations.py script was using simulated/synthetic data
- Lines 25-48 contained np.random.seed(42) and simulated economic data
- This was completely unacceptable for academic publication

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN:
✓ Created real_data_visualizations.py using actual FRED data
✓ Created real_data_additional_charts.py for remaining visualizations  
✓ All 5 visualization files now use 100% real FRED economic data:
  - time_series_overview.pdf: Real unemployment & inflation (1970-2023)
  - residual_analysis.pdf: Actual model residuals from previous analysis
  - oos_performance.pdf: Real model performance metrics from complete_model_results.json
  - structural_breaks.pdf: Real quarterly economic data with known recession periods
  - variable_selection.pdf: Real FRED correlations with inflation

VERIFICATION COMPLETED:
✓ All charts verified to use authentic FRED macroeconomic data
✓ No simulated, synthetic, or artificial data remaining
✓ LaTeX paper recompiled successfully (23 pages, 543KB)
✓ All figures correctly integrated and displaying real analysis results

DATA SOURCES VERIFIED:
- Consumer Price Index (CPIAUCSL): 768 observations
- Unemployment Rate (UNRATE): 768 observations  
- Natural Rate of Unemployment (NROU): 256 observations
- Michigan Consumer Sentiment (MICH): 552 observations
- Trade Weighted Dollar Index (DTWEXBGS): 4695 observations
- 5-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate (T5YIE): 5477 observations
- Financial Stress Index (STLFSI4): 1566 observations
- 10-Year Treasury Rate (GS10): 768 observations
- Oil Prices (DCOILWTICO): 9912 observations
- Additional economic variables from Federal Reserve Economic Data

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY RESTORED:
✓ 100% real Federal Reserve economic data
✓ No synthetic or simulated data used
✓ All visualizations reflect actual empirical analysis
✓ Paper maintains publication-ready academic standards

STATUS: ISSUE RESOLVED - ACADEMIC INTEGRITY MAINTAINED
