ACADEMIC INTEGRITY ASSESSMENT LOG
=====================================
Agent: Leibniz, VoxGenius Inc.
Date: 2025-07-29
Assessment Type: Pre-Publication Review

ASSESSMENT OUTCOME: NOT READY FOR PUBLICATION
============================================

CRITICAL FINDING: We would risk academic embarrassment and potential integrity issues if we published this work in its current state.

HIGH-RISK ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
- Unvalidated performance enhancement claims (+18.3pp RÂ²)
- Claims based on simplified estimation, not actual fitted models
- No proper out-of-sample validation implemented

MODERATE-RISK ISSUES:
- Insufficient literature review and citation
- Structural stability not tested (critical for Phillips Curve)
- Multiple testing problem not addressed

METHODOLOGICAL GAPS:
- Enhancement claims not based on actual enhanced model fitting
- ALFRED real-time validation mentioned but not implemented
- Overfitting risk not properly assessed
- Economic significance vs statistical significance conflated

RECOMMENDATION: SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL WORK REQUIRED
==================================================

The current work demonstrates a systematic approach to model enhancement but falls short of publication-ready academic standards. We would risk:

1. Academic embarrassment due to unsubstantiated claims
2. Potential integrity concerns from overselling results
3. Peer review rejection due to methodological gaps

NEXT STEPS IF PURSUING PUBLICATION:
- Implement complete enhanced model fitting
- Conduct proper out-of-sample validation
- Address structural break testing
- Comprehensive literature review
- Multiple testing corrections
- Economic interpretation and significance analysis

CURRENT STATUS: FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED, SUBSTANTIAL WORK REMAINING
