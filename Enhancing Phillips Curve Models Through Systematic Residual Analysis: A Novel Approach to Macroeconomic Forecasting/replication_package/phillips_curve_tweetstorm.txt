TWEET STORM: Phillips Curve Paper (@mbusigin style)

1/
The Phillips Curve has been "dead" more times than crypto.

But what if the problem isn't the model - it's that we've been throwing away the most valuable information?

New paper: We turned the residuals into rocket fuel.

2/
Everyone knows the baseline Phillips Curve is garbage. R² = 0.006. 

That's not a typo. It explains 0.6% of inflation variation.

Most economists: "The model is broken"
Me: "The errors ARE the model"

3/
Here's what nobody tells you about econometric residuals: they cluster around *exactly* the moments that matter.

Oil shocks. Financial crises. COVID.

The model doesn't fail randomly. It fails systematically. And that's exploitable.

4/
So we built a systematic residual analysis framework. Not sexy, but devastatingly effective.

Result: R² goes from 0.006 to 0.410. 

That's a 68x improvement. In econometrics, that's basically finding a $100 bill on the sidewalk.

5/
The framework discovered what every macro trader already knows:
- Oil prices matter (duh)
- Dollar strength drives import costs
- Market expectations > survey expectations

But here's the kicker: it found the OPTIMAL lags. No hand-waving.

6/
Best part? We can predict recessions using Phillips Curve failures.

When the model catastrophically misfires (residuals >2σ), recession probability spikes. AUC = 0.62 for 12-month ahead prediction.

The "broken" model is actually an early warning system.

7/
This is classic Type II error in economics. Everyone's so focused on making models that never fail, they miss that the failures contain alpha.

It's like throwing away outliers in your backtest. Congrats, you just deleted all the regime changes.

8/
Technical details for the nerds:
- Full FRED data, no synthetic BS
- Bonferroni correction for multiple testing
- Out-of-sample R² = 0.39 (barely degraded!)
- Real-time implementable

Why this matters: Every central bank runs Phillips Curve models. They all suck. They all fail at turning points.

But if you systematically analyze WHERE they fail, you get:
1) Better inflation forecasts
2) Recession early warnings
3) Actual insight into structural breaks

10/
The meta-lesson: In complex systems, errors aren't noise - they're signal.

The Phillips Curve isn't broken. Our whole approach to model "failure" is.

Time to stop throwing away the most valuable information in economics.

(BTW pleeeease @AnthropicAI give us Opus 4. I will pay 10x per token to analyze more residuals)
